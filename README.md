# X-Wing-Compendium

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/FaleshSB/X-Wing-Compendium/releases).

The X-Wing Compendium is a collection of tools including a squad builder, collection manager, research tool, quiz and squad spawner for Vassal. I plan to keep it up to date with the latest FAQ and also add more stuff down the line. There is one caviat on this, I have M.E. (chronic fatigue) so I can only work when I have some spare energy. If I ever have to drop this project I will hand it over to someone else who wishes to continue it.

It is not perfectly bug free, or amazingly designed (I hate working on the UI), but I thought I might as well release it now as I use it all the time and so thought others might too.

# Squad Builder

To add a pilot press the Add Pilot button. To add an upgrade to that pilot press Add Upgrade under the pilot card. To remove a card hover over it with your mouse and press the X button at the top right of the card. You can also swap the pilot while keeping all the upgrades that are compatible with that new pilot by pressing the Swap Pilot button.

# Card Browser

When browsing cards you can use any combination of the following to help find the cards you want

* Enter any word in the search box above to find Upgraes/Pilots with that name
* 'all' will show all the Upgrades or Pilots depending on which is selected
* 'PS8' or 'PS4-7', using any numbers, will show pilots of, or between, that Pilot Skill
* '8' or '4-7', using any numbers, will show cards of, or between, that cost
* 'torpedo' or 'tech', using any upgrade, will show cards of that are, or can use, that upgrade
* 'rebel', 'scum' or 'imperial' will show cards of that faction
* 'Y-Wing' or 'TIE/fo', using any ship name, will show pilots who use that ship
* 'small' or 'large' will show pilots whose ships are of that size

# Collection Manager

You might have noticed a number on each of the cards in the above images. That number is how many of them are in your collection. When you hover your mouse curser over a card a plus and minus button appears. Simply press the plus or minus until you have the correct number that you own. This feature helps you make squads as you can easily see which cards you own.

# Sharing and Vassal

To use a squad you have built in Vassal, 7.0.3 or higher, select Vassal 7.0.3+ from the dropdown and press the copy button. After that paste in the "Spawn Squad" popup in Vassal. I have also added a few other options that let you copy a formatted text version of your squad so you can easily share in on Reddit, Facebook, Forums, etc.

# Quiz

In this image you can see the three different quiz questions cut and pasted next to each other. Try to work out what the name of the card is, or which ship can do the maneuver and then click Show Name to see if you were correct.

# Extra Info

If you click the ? button on any card a popup appears which shows which expansions contain the card and any extra info from the official FAQ.
