# X-Wing-Compendium

The X-Wing Compendium is a collection of tools including a squad builder, collection manager, research tool, quiz and squad spawner for Vassal. I plan to keep it up to date with the latest FAQ and also add more stuff down the line. There is one caviat on this, I have M.E. (chronic fatigue) so I can only work when I have some spare energy. If I ever have to drop this project I will hand it over to someone else who wishes to continue it.
